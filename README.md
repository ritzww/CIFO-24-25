<h1>Wedding Seating Optimization Project</h1>
Project developed during Computaitonal Intelligence for Optimization class (2024/2025 NOVA IMS)

<h3>Project Description</h3>
The goal of this project is to optimize seating arrangement of guests across tables to maximize guest happiness and minimize conflicts based on their relationships.

Each solution represents a complete seating arrangement, specifying which guests are seated at each table. These are the constraints that must be verified in every solution of the search space (no object is considered a solution if it doesn’t comply with these):
- Each guest must be assigned to exactly one table;
- Table placement matters only in terms of grouping. The arrangement within a table is irrelevant.

Apart from implementing the Genetic Algorithm to solve this problem, we also implemented Simmulated Annealing Algorithm and Hill Climbing.
